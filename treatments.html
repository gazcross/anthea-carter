            Reiki is an ancient and simple Japanese healing technique using natural healing energy to restore balance
            and encourages the body's natural ability to heal itself. You will remain fully clothed laying comfortably on the massage couch or seated on a chair
            where a series on non-invasive hand positions are used. If a massage has already been received, you will remain covered with towels.
